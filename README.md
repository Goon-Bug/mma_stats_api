## Usage

This program can be used to create your own Mysql database of MMA statistics taken from the Sherdog.com MMA rankings.

It uses selenium to web scrape fighter data from the latest Sherdog.com top 10 rankings and inputs the data into a database.
This database is then used in the API section so that the information can be accessed easily.

It also includes a Unit Test section to be able to test the API without having to test each command individually.</p>
